This project is for a managers who want to supervise and manage schedule of guards from day to day in a thousands of hecta asset's area.

This is a front-end project for TechPro company - a company for researching and developing high level of technology and software solution.
For the completion of this project, we use:
1. Jquery for interacting with the DOM easily, making ajax to interact with data on server, sorting in jqueryUI.
2. Bootstrap Meterail Design for making the UI better nicer in an easy way.
3. Sweet alert for showing warning, success, danger, error info to users beautifully instead of using alert, confirm in javascript.
4. Bootstrap-datetimepicker (create a box of time choosing), 
5. ChartJS (create a statistic charts for easily analyzing data listed on table)
6. table2Excel (exporting excel file to user for data listed on table)
7. Google Font-awesome for making icon from svg easily.
8. Leaflet vs mapBox to make a realtime map. The maps allowed users can see the current situations of people who are supervised. However,
leaflet do not have function of overseeing from satelite.
9. Google Map API is a suitable for overview from satelite. Moreover, google map already had the functions that leaflet brought out. 
10. Techniques: request realtime into server for 1 time per 1 minute using ajax in jquery, async vs await for handling asynchronous in getting
data from database server base on promise configuration.
